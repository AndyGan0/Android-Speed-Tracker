# Android-Speed-Tracker
This was a project created during my university's course "CURRENT TOPICS OF SOFTWARE ENGINEERING -SOFTWARE FOR MOBILE DEVICES"<br>
Language: Java (in Android studio)<br><br>

This is an android app that checks user's current speed in the background and compares it with the speed limit set by the user. <br>
If speed limit is exceeded then the app alarms the user and keeps a record of this surpass in the local database.
